## Introduction
ETSAuto 2 is an autonomous driving system for Euro Truck Simulator 2, which includes Lane Centering Control (LCC), Lane Change Assistance (ALC), and Forward Collision Warning (FCW) features. ETSAuto 2 is built in pure Python and runs on Windows system. It uses the ONNXRuntime for inference (also supports the TensorRT inference framework) and currently offers acceleration on Nvidia GPUs, with future support for AMD GPUs. In terms of perception, it achieves a response rate of less than 0.05ms and uses pure pursuit for vehicle control.

## Features
| Scenario   | Support | Description |
| ---        | ---     | ---         |
| Daytime    | ✓       | All features supported |
| Nighttime  | ✓       | Not recommended for high-speed lane changes |
| Highway    | ✓       | No longitudinal planning; deceleration required when exiting the highway |
| City Roads | ✓       | Intersection functionality disabled; no lane markings or curbs on both sides |
| Rural Roads| ✓       | No lane markings or curbs on both sides |

| Feature              | Support | Description       |
| ---                  | :---:   | ---               |
| Lane Centering Control (LCC) | ✓ | v < 80km/h  |
| Lane Change Assistance (ALC) | ✓ | 15km/h < v < 80km/h  |
| Forward Collision Warning (LCW) | ✓ |  |
| Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)  | ✗ |  |

## Environment Setup
For environment setup, refer to [BUILD.md](https://github.com/Yutong-gannis/ETSAuto/blob/v2.x/docs/BUILD.md)

Considering compatibility with graphics cards, from version 2.0 onwards, ONNX Runtime will be mainly used for inference. Nvidia graphics cards are currently supported, and support for AMD graphics cards is planned. However, since there is no AMD graphics card available at the moment, developers are encouraged to attempt building on AMD graphics cards. The project still retains the interface for TensorRT inference to ensure necessary perception response rates. Due to reasons related to screen capture and vjoy control programs, the program currently supports only Windows. Developers are welcome to provide alternative solutions for these two codes on Linux systems.

## Usage Instructions
+ Program Entry

  Double click `ETSAuto.bat` to open the program.

+ Key Instructions

  To facilitate operation, keyboard controls are used for functionalities.
